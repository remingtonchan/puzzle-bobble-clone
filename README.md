# puzzle-bobble-clone

Quick implementation of Puzzle Bobble in Unity.

Core gameplay:
- The board is prefilled with balls.
- The player can shoot balls to the board.
- When colors of the same color are linked together, they are all removed.
- Any ball that is not connected to the top row will also be eliminated.
- The row of balls will fall downward in intervals.
- The game ends when the player clears the board or when the balls reach the game over line.
